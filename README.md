## Response
Yo, it's time to talk about a game
That's got the whole world going insane
A sport that's fast, precise, and strong
It's called ping pong, let's get our game on
The ball flies back and forth with ease
As we smash it over the net with speed
It's a game of skill and strategy
Where only the strongest can claim victory

Chorus:
We shall ping, we shall pong!
That sounds like a plan man, let's get it on
Next week it's on like ping pong
We'll battle it out until the break of dawn

Verse 2:
I step up to the table, paddle in hand
Ready to show the world that I am the man
My opponent's on the other side
But I won't let that throw off my stride
I focus, I breathe, and then I strike
With a lightning fast serve, it's like a spike
My opponent returns with all his might
But I'm ready for it, I'm on my game tonight

Chorus:
We shall ping, we shall pong!
That sounds like a plan man, let's get it on
Next week it's on like ping pong
We'll battle it out until the break of dawn

Verse 3:
The crowd is on their feet, cheering loud
As we continue to battle it out
The tension's high, the pressure's on
But we're both in the zone, we can't go wrong
We hit the ball back and forth, back and forth
And with each shot, we prove our worth
But in the end, there can only be one
The champion of ping pong, the king of fun

Chorus:
We shall ping, we shall pong!
That sounds like a plan man, let's get it on
Next week it's on like ping pong
We'll battle it out until the break of dawn

Outro:
So if you wanna test your skills
And show the world your ping pong thrills
Just grab a paddle and get in the zone
'Cause next week it's on like ping pong!
