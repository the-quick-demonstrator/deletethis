## Response<br />
Yo, it's time to talk about a game<br />
That's got the whole world going insane<br />
A sport that's fast, precise, and strong<br />
It's called ping pong, let's get our game on<br />
The ball flies back and forth with ease<br />
As we smash it over the net with speed<br />
It's a game of skill and strategy<br />
Where only the strongest can claim victory<br />

**Chorus:**<br />
We shall ping, we shall pong!<br />
That sounds like a plan man, let's get it on<br />
Next week it's on like ping pong<br />
We'll battle it out until the break of dawn<br />

**Verse 2:**<br />
I step up to the table, paddle in hand<br />
Ready to show the world that I am the man<br />
My opponent's on the other side<br />
But I won't let that throw off my stride<br />
I focus, I breathe, and then I strike<br />
With a lightning fast serve, it's like a spike<br />
My opponent returns with all his might<br />
But I'm ready for it, I'm on my game tonight<br />

**Chorus:**<br />
We shall ping, we shall pong!<br />
That sounds like a plan man, let's get it on<br />
Next week it's on like ping pong<br />
We'll battle it out until the break of dawn<br />

**Verse 3:**<br />
The crowd is on their feet, cheering loud<br />
As we continue to battle it out<br />
The tension's high, the pressure's on<br />
But we're both in the zone, we can't go wrong<br />
We hit the ball back and forth, back and forth<br />
And with each shot, we prove our worth<br />
But in the end, there can only be one<br />
The champion of ping pong, the king of fun<br />

**Chorus:**<br />
We shall ping, we shall pong!<br />
That sounds like a plan man, let's get it on<br />
Next week it's on like ping pong<br />
We'll battle it out until the break of dawn<br />

**Outro:**<br />
So if you wanna test your skills<br />
And show the world your ping pong thrills<br />
Just grab a paddle and get in the zone<br />
'Cause next week it's on like ping pong!
